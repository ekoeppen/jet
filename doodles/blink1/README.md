The JET/blink demo in React, with all the code running in the browser.

(based on Dan Abramov's [react-hot-boilerplate][RHBP] live reload example)

**Status**

https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/issues/16

**Usage**

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Now edit `scripts/App.js`.  
Your changes will appear without reloading the browser like in [this video](http://vimeo.com/100010922).
